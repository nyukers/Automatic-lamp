# Automatic Lamps

The Automatic Lamps project aims to create a smart lighting system that automatically adjusts the brightness and color temperature of lamps based on external factors such as ambient light, time of day, and user preferences.

## Features

- **Ambient Light Detection**: The lamps are equipped with sensors to detect the ambient light levels in the environment and adjust their brightness accordingly.
- **Time-based Lighting**: The lamps can be programmed to change their brightness and color temperature based on the time of day, creating a more natural lighting experience.
- **User Preferences**: Users can customize the lighting settings according to their preferences through a mobile app or a web interface.
- **Energy Efficiency**: The lamps are designed to optimize energy consumption by dimming or turning off when there is sufficient natural light or no one is present in the room.
- **Integration with Smart Home Systems**: The Automatic Lamps can be integrated with popular smart home systems such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, allowing users to control the lighting through voice commands.

## Installation

To install the Automatic Lamps system, follow these steps:

1. Mount the lamps in the desired locations in your home or office.
2. Connect the lamps to a central hub or Wi-Fi network.
3. Download and install the mobile app from the app store or access the web interface.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to connect the lamps to the app or web interface.

## Usage

Once the Automatic Lamps system is installed and connected, you can:

- Adjust the brightness and color temperature of individual lamps or groups of lamps through the app or web interface.
- Create schedules to automate the lighting based on specific times or events.
- Access advanced settings to fine-tune the lighting behavior and preferences.

## Future Enhancements

The Automatic Lamps project is an ongoing development effort, and future enhancements may include:

- Integration with motion sensors for presence detection.
- Integration with weather data to adapt lighting based on weather conditions.
- Support for additional smart home platforms and voice assistants.
